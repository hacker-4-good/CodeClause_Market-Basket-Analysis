# Market Basket Analysis in Python using Apriori Algorithm

## • Introduction

Machine Learning is helping the retail industry in many different ways. We can imagine that from forecasting the performance of sales to identifying the buyers, there are many applications of machine learning (artificial intelligence) in the retail industry. “Market Basket Analysis” is one of the best applications of machine learning in the retail industry. By analyzing the past purchase behavior of customers, we can find out which products are frequently bought together by the customers.

## • What is Market Basket Analysis?

A popular example of frequent itemset mining is Market Basket Analysis. This process identifies customer buying habits by finding associations between the different items that customers place in their “shopping baskets,” as you can see in the following figure. The discovery of this kind of association will be helpful for retailers or marketers to develop marketing strategies by gaining insight into which items are frequently bought together by customers, whether from a grocery store or online retail.

For example, if customers are buying milk, how probably are they to also buy bread (and which kind of bread) on the same trip to the supermarket? This information may lead to an increase in sales by helping retailers to do selective marketing based on predictions, cross-selling, and planning their ledge space for optimal product placement.
